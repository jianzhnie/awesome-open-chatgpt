# Awesome-Open-ChatGPT

ChatGPT is GPT-3.5 with RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback) for chat system.

By alternative, I mean projects feature different language model for chat system. 
Projects are **not** counted if they are:
- alternative frontend projects because they just call the API from OpenAI. 
- alternative transformer decoder models to GPT 3.5 either because the training data of them are (mostly) not for chat system.

Tags:

-   B: bare (no data, no model's weight, no chat system)
-   M: mildly bare (yes data, yes model's weight, bare chat via API)
-   F: full (yes data, yes model's weight, fancy chat system including TUI and GUI)
-   C: complicated (semi open source, not really open souce, based on closed model, ...)
